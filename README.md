# 🧠 How It Works
- The browser asks for your current location

- Once permission is granted, it:

- Centers the map on your area

- Calls APIs to get nearby events and news headlines

- Filters them by distance (e.g., 10 km radius)

- Displays markers on the map only for active, local data

- The app refreshes the data periodically to simulate real-time updates
